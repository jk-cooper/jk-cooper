# 👋 Hi, I’m Joe

A computer programming student at Austin Community College.  Not only do I have years of experience in client-facing roles such as account management and marketing but I have also operated my own small business and am now pursuing computer science as a third career.  My favorite languages are Python and Java but I have developed an understanding of C++ (including data structures), SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS.  I also have experience managing small-scale databases in Access and have an interest in larger database development.
